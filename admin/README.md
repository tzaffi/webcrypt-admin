In the spirit of Kerchkoff's law, I'm making the assignment
generating code available to everyone.  This means, that
if you can crack my assignment generating algorithm (so
are able to figure out what random seed I used on any given assignment)
you will automatically be able to get all the cryptanalysis
problems right.

Though some would consider this cheating, given the point of the course
to learn about cryptology, cracking my algorithm definitely deserves
an A+, at least on the cryptanalysis portion of the course!!!!
