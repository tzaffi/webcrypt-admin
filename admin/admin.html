* In the spirit of Kerchkoff's law, I'm making the assignment
* generating code available to everyone.  This means, that
* if you can crack my assignment generating algorithm (so
* are able to figure out what random seed I used on any given assignment)
* you will automatically be able to get all the cryptanalysis
* problems right.
*
* Though some would consider this cheating, given the point of the course
* to learn about cryptology, cracking my algorithm definitely deserves
* an A+, at least on the cryptanalysis portion of the course!!!!
